skip getting stock data of those w / an entry in error table

crontab task to update historical data, also upload database to dropbox/djinnius or something. create backup 

[DONE]dump stock data into central StockData database. each list is on a different day so you won't gain any benefit from preventing multiple entries, and you'll probably sufffer a bit of a performance hit since all data is dumped in one spot, you'll proly keep yourself more sane (at least right now) 

research using openbloomberg or another trading platforms api

Analysis of at $7/trade how much you would actually make or how much you'd have to spend to make any profit. or make a reasonable profit. 

what is the typical % gain/loss when on the list?

Grab the SP500 data once and make all other calls use that.

Finish the Refresh script, filling in all options.
If the options aren't there then add them to the files

automate testing of the Refresh Script
utilize the temp directory
Add the SP500 and other indexes to the ticker list to check performance, may need to tweak insertion as they proly won't have  volume etc. Could use a ETF that tracks them as a proxy.
