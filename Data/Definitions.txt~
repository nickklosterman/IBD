IBD® 100 Index

The IBD 100 was discontinued on January 3, 2011, and replaced with the IBD 50.  It was a computer-generated ranking of leading companies trading in the United States.  Rankings were based on a combination of each company's recent profit growth record; IBD's Composite Rating; and relative price performance in the most recent 12 months.  

IBD® 50 Index

The IBD 50 replaced the IBD 100 on January 3, 2011.  Improvements were made to the list, which have resulted in more insritutional-quality stocks being included.  The IBD 50 runs every Monday in the IBD newspaper and can be found in the Screen Center every Friday evening around 9pm EST on Investors.com.  It is a computer-generated ranking of leading companies trading in the U.S.  Rankings are based on a combination of each company's recent profit growth record; IBD's Composite Rating, which includes key measures such as return on equity, sales growth and profit margins; and relative price performance in the last 12 months.  A company's inclusion in the list should not be viewed as a recommendation.
