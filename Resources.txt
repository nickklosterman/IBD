http://www.yqlblog.net/blog/2009/06/02/getting-stock-information-with-yql-and-open-data-tables/ using open tables, pretty much the same info seen below.

The developer.yahoo.com is the url for the console app. the query.yahooapis.com is the query to use to return the data.
XML:
http://developer.yahoo.com/yql/console/?q=select%20*%20from%20yahoo.finance.quotes%20where%20symbol%20in%20%28%22YHOO%22%2C%22AAPL%22%2C%22GOOG%22%2C%22MSFT%22%29%0A%09%09&env=http%3A%2F%2Fdatatables.org%2Falltables.env
http://query.yahooapis.com/v1/public/yql?q=select%20*%20from%20yahoo.finance.quotes%20where%20symbol%20in%20(%22YHOO%22%2C%22AAPL%22%2C%22GOOG%22%2C%22MSFT%22)%0A%09%09&diagnostics=true&env=http%3A%2F%2Fdatatables.org%2Falltables.env
JSON:
http://developer.yahoo.com/yql/console/?q=select%20*%20from%20yahoo.finance.quotes%20where%20symbol%20in%20%28%22YHOO%22%2C%22AAPL%22%2C%22GOOG%22%2C%22MSFT%22%29%0A%09%09&env=http%3A%2F%2Fdatatables.org%2Falltables.env
http://query.yahooapis.com/v1/public/yql?q=select%20*%20from%20yahoo.finance.quotes%20where%20symbol%20in%20(%22YHOO%22%2C%22AAPL%22%2C%22GOOG%22%2C%22MSFT%22)%0A%09%09&format=json&diagnostics=true&env=http%3A%2F%2Fdatatables.org%2Falltables.env&callback=cbfunc

I wanted the major indices but couldn't run the normal query on ^DJI, ^GSPC, ^IXIC. When searching for obtaining the info I saw Yahoo display the url (https://www.google.com/search?q=yahoo+finance+sp+500+index&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a#hl=en&client=firefox-a&hs=eRy&rls=org.mozilla:en-US%3Aofficial&sclient=psy-ab&q=yahoo+finance+djia+index&oq=yahoo+finance+djia+index&gs_l=serp.3..0i30j0i8i30.105611.107866.0.108124.4.4.0.0.0.0.109.363.3j1.4.0.les%3B..0.0...1c.1.rdq31XhGpHc&pbx=1&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.&fp=27ebbc7ad671d56a&bpcl=34622188&biw=1181&bih=772) for the ticker with %5E in place of the ^. This worked for ^GSPC and ^IXIC but doesn't work for ^DJI.
