To create a matrix of rankings for a single stock:
get the list of available dates (possibly set all ranks to 0)
get the date,rank data for that stock.
use the date as the index to set the rank for the date.
Loop through and for all empty rankings have a decrementing counter and set the rank to that.


Create script that will go through and get stock data for the specified stock on the date+1 given
but want it to be displayed/viewable online! Interface database w/ java or javascript utlities.
